Time Series Forecasting: ARIMA, SARIMA, and XGBoost
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive comparison of three popular time series forecasting algorithms: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting). The goal is to determine which algorithm is best suited for forecasting data and to forecast data for a particular period.

Introduction
Time series forecasting is a crucial aspect of data analysis, enabling businesses and researchers to predict future values based on historical data. This project aims to compare the effectiveness of ARIMA, SARIMA, and XGBoost models in forecasting time series data. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and this comparison will help identify the best model for different scenarios.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains time series data that will be used to train and evaluate the models. It includes historical data points with a temporal component, which is essential for time series forecasting.

Algorithms
ARIMA
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a popular statistical method for time series forecasting. It combines three components: autoregression (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA). ARIMA models are suitable for data with trends but not for seasonal data.

SARIMA
SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) extends ARIMA by adding a seasonal component. This makes SARIMA suitable for data with both trends and seasonality. The model includes additional parameters to capture the seasonal patterns in the data.

XGBoost
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful machine learning algorithm that has been widely used for various predictive modeling tasks. While it is not inherently designed for time series data, it can be adapted for time series forecasting by creating lag features and other relevant time-based features.

Results
The results section will present a detailed comparison of the model performances based on the evaluation metrics. It will include tables and visualizations to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each model.

Conclusion
Based on the evaluation results, we will conclude which model performs best for the given dataset and provide insights into the scenarios where each model excels. The conclusion will also discuss potential improvements and future work.
